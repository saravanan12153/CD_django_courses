Courses
Now that we’ve actually attached a database to our Django server and have started to appreciate the magic of ORMs, let’s put it to use!
Make a Django project allowing you to add a courses (with name and description) to a table. Create a button that gets added with each course that allows you to remove the particular course it is attached to.


Felisa's note:
The screenshot folder features a quick view of the templates. These have no bearing on the functionality.
